# Arkham Horror LCG Tracker

An Investigator status tracker that's mostly there to help me learn React.

TODO: (In no particular order)

- [] Host on Github Pages
- [] Add all Investigators (ugh, chore)
- [] Add better selector & investigator count (i.e. an 'Add' button)
- [] Save/export and import state - chosen investigators, initial trauma, etc
- [] Campaign Tracker
- [] Chaos Bag tracker
